Modify bin/minify.sh to match you're development environment.

Run bin/minify.sh to update site for deployment.

Please use Gruntfile.js whenever possible to handle deployment automation.

When you add JavaScript or css to a src/*.html you need to add it to 
the deployment process in bin/minify.sh. When you remove something you 
need to do the same.
